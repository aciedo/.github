# üëã Hi there

We're Valera. ***We make payment tech.*** Or in more words, we're an early-stage payment technology firm developing cutting edge hardware and software using Bitcoin, the internet's native currency. Est. 722,913.

From daily coffees ‚òï to corporate treasuries üíº, we help people ~~trust~~ **verify** their money. We support the 1.7 billion that banks rejected, and we help the 7.97 billion protect themselves against cancerous inflation.

## ü§ñ Our tech

We take pride in our engineering - both software and hardware.

- We're avid Rustaceans and use Rust everywhere from our Lightning nodes to our payment hardware.
- Our first-party apps are written native for their respective platforms, using Swift and Kotlin.
- Web apps are written in SvelteKit and TypeScript.
- Nearly all of our code is open source. Anything that runs on a device we don't own will always use open source software exclusively. Our server-side tech is closed source, however.
- Customer privacy is our top priority, and we self-host all our server-side tech. Any data you send to us is exclusively to us, not to a CDN or other third-party.

## ü§ù Looking for a job?
