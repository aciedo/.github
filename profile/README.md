# 👋 Hi there

We're Aciedo. ***We make payment tech.*** Or in more words, we're an early-stage payment technology firm developing cutting edge hardware and software using Bitcoin, the internet's native currency. Est. 722,913.

From daily coffees ☕ to corporate treasuries 💼, we help people ~~trust~~ **verify** their money. We support the 1.7 billion that banks rejected, and we help everyone else protect themselves against cancerous inflation.

## 🤖 Our tech

We take pride in our engineering - both software and hardware.

- We're avid **Rustaceans** and use **Rust 🦀** *everywhere* from our Lightning nodes to our payment hardware.
- Our first-party apps are written native for their respective platforms, using **Swift** and **Kotlin**.
- Web apps are written in **Rust** using **Leptos**.
- All of our client code is open source. Anything that runs on a device we don't own will always use open source software exclusively. 
- We use a in-house developed RPC protocol called [**HardLight**](https://github.com/aciedo/hardlight) for real-time client-server comms
